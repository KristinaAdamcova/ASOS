3. #### Local Events Finder

    The application will help users discover cultural and sports events happening around them based on their location and time.

    - User Accounts: Users can log in, save favorite events, or receive notifications for upcoming events.
    - Event Booking: Integration with a booking system for users to buy tickets directly.
    - Notifications: Option to notify users when new events are added in their area or when an event they’ve saved is near.
